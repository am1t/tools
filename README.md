# Pocket Tools ðŸ”§

A collection of simple, self-contained web tools. Each tool is a single HTML file with no external dependencies.

## Philosophy

- **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **One File Per Tool**: Each tool is completely self-contained in a single `index.html` file
- **No Dependencies**: No frameworks, no build tools, no external libraries (unless absolutely necessary)
- **Mobile-Friendly**: All tools should work well on mobile devices
- **Zero Setup**: Just open the HTML file in a browser

## Available Tools

All tools are hosted at **[tools.amitgawande.com](https://tools.amitgawande.com)**

Current tools:
- **[Counter](https://tools.amitgawande.com/counter/)** - Simple counting tool with keyboard shortcuts
- **[Untrack](https://tools.amitgawande.com/untrack/)** - Remove tracking parameters from URLs

Tools are automatically discovered from the root directory. Each tool must have:
- An `index.html` file (the tool itself)
- A `README.md` file with metadata (category, created date, updated date) and description

Each tool is a folder at the root level and accessible at `/<folder-name>/`

## Adding New Tools

1. Create a new directory at the root level with a descriptive name (use kebab-case)
2. Create an `index.html` file in that directory (the tool itself)
3. Create a `README.md` file in that directory with:
   - Tool name as h1 (`# Tool Name`)
   - Metadata section with category, created date, and updated date
   - Description section
   - Any additional sections (Features, Usage, etc.)
4. Follow the self-contained pattern (see `counter/` for reference)
5. Run `python generate-index.py` to update the main index page

See `counter/README.md` for the required format.

## Structure

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # This file (project overview)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html                   # Auto-generated landing page
â”œâ”€â”€ generate-index.py            # Script to generate index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ Claude.md                    # Instructions for Claude Code
â””â”€â”€ counter/                     # Each tool is a folder at root level
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Self-contained tool
    â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Tool metadata and description
```

## Building

To regenerate the landing page:

```bash
python generate-index.py
```

This will scan the root directory for tool folders (those with both `index.html` and `README.md`), and generate a new `index.html` with links to all tools.
